# valvemodel
C++ library for modelling valves, including triode and pentode models.

- Pentode support includes legacy Gardiner/Reefman models and a new `SimpleManualPentode` backend that uses a web-style `epk` anode-current function and is intended to be driven by UI sliders in the ValveWorkbench app.
