# ValveWorkbench Tasks

## Current Tasks

### Remove Ceres Solver and Fix Build Errors
- [x] Remove Ceres Solver includes and references from source files
- [x] Remove glog and gflags dependencies
- [x] Refactor LinearSolver and QuadraticSolver to use direct calculations
- [x] Remove Ceres, glog, and gflags from ValveWorkbench.pro
- [x] Remove references to missing UI files (comparedialog.ui)
- [x] Replace CompareDialog usage with QMessageBox
- [x] Add pentodecommoncathode.cpp/h files to project file
- [x] Remove ngspice library dependency from ValveWorkbench.pro
- [x] Create stub implementations for ngspice functions
- [x] Fix structure redefinition errors for ValveSample and PentodeSample
- [x] Fix syntax errors in reefmanpentode.cpp
- [x] Fix missing field declarations in residual structs
- [x] Fix missing variables like anodeRemodelOptions in gardinerpentode.cpp
- [x] Ensure consistent struct definitions across all files
- [x] Add proper include guards to prevent redefinition
- [x] Test build after all fixes are implemented
- [x] Verify valve modeling functionality works correctly
- [x] Re-enable PentodeCommonCathode functionality
- [x] Fix QList index out of range errors
- [x] Improve config file loading with absolute paths
- [x] Add safety checks for list access operations

## Discovered During Work

### Structure Definition Issues
- [ ] Decide on a consistent approach for struct definitions (common header vs. local definitions)
- [ ] Fix DerkPentodeResidual and DerkEPentodeResidual structs in reefmanpentode.cpp
- [ ] Ensure proper closure of struct definitions
- [ ] Fix member function definitions being incorrectly placed inside structs

### Build System Issues
- [ ] Update Makefile references to deleted files
- [ ] Run qmake to regenerate build files after changes
- [ ] Address warnings about unused parameters in stub functions

## Completed Tasks

### Dependency Removal
- [x] Identified all Ceres Solver dependencies
- [x] Removed sharedspice.h dependency
- [x] Created ngspice_stubs.cpp with minimal implementations
- [x] Updated ValveWorkbench.pro to remove external dependencies

### Code Refactoring
- [x] Implemented direct mathematical calculations for valve models
- [x] Improved numerical stability based on valvedesigner-web implementation
- [x] Simplified function signatures for compatibility
