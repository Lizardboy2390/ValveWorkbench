#include "qcustomplot.h"

// This is a simplified implementation of QCustomPlot
// In a real implementation, this file would contain all the drawing code
// For our purposes, this stub implementation is sufficient to compile the project

// We don't need to implement anything here since we've defined everything as inline in the header
// This file exists mainly to provide a proper compilation target for the .pro file
