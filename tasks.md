# Valve Workbench - Task Tracking & Change Log

## Overview
This document tracks every code change, task performed, and development activity for the Valve Workbench project. All changes must be documented here before implementation.

## Current Status
- **Designer Tab Implemented**: Triode Common Cathode calculator fully ported with UI, plotting, and calculations
- **Runtime Issue**: Application crashes when selecting "Triode Common Cathode" due to unresolved initialization error
- **Grid Calibration UI Added**: Preferences dialog now stores measured −5 V/−60 V grid readings and exposes helper API; analyser hookup deferred pending validation
- **Next Phase**: Debug and fix the runtime crash to ensure stable operation

## Task Tracking System

### Task Status Definitions

- **[ ] pending**: Issue identified, fix implemented, awaiting compilation and testing
- **[ ] pending - AWAITING USER TESTING AND CONFIRMATION**: Fix implemented and compiled, user needs to test and confirm functionality works
- **[x] completed**: User has tested and confirmed functionality works as expected

**Rule: No task marked as "completed" until user confirms it works through testing.**

- **cancelled**: Task no longer needed
- **blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Change Log Format
Each code change must include:
- **Date/Time**: When change was made
- **Files Modified**: List of files changed with line numbers
- **Description**: What was changed and why
- **Impact**: How this affects functionality
- **Testing**: What was tested to validate the change
- **Approval**: Who approved the change (if required)

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] **Debug TriodeCommonCathode Circuit Selection Crash**
  - Status: pending - AWAITING FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
  - Owner: [TBD]
  - Description: Application crashes when selecting "Triode Common Cathode" from dropdown
  - Root Cause: TriodeCommonCathode::plot() method creates QGraphicsItemGroup but never adds any visual segments to it
  - Expected Files: `triodecommoncathode.cpp`
  - Success Criteria: Circuit selection works without crashes
  - **Fix Applied**: Updated plot method to create actual line segments

### Medium Priority
- [x] **Verify Device Dropdown Population**
  - Status: completed - USER TESTED AND CONFIRMED
  - Owner: [Fixed]
  - Description: Device 1 and Device 2 dropdowns show no options
  - Root Cause: Constant mismatch - Device returned MODEL_TRIODE (undefined) but circuit expected TRIODE (1)
  - Expected Files: `valvemodel/model/device.h`, `valvemodel/model/device.cpp`
  - Success Criteria: Dropdowns populated with available triode models
  - **Fix Applied**: Updated Device class to use main application constants

- [ ] **Fix Load Line Plot Display**
  - Status: pending - AWAITING FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
  - Owner: [TBD]
  - Description: Parameter boxes visible but no graphs displayed
  - Root Cause: Plot generation creates empty graphics groups without visual elements
  - Expected Files: `triodecommoncathode.cpp`, plot-related files
  - Success Criteria: Load line graphs display when circuit selected

- [ ] **Double Triode Modelling Pipeline**
  - Status: pending
  - Owner: assistant (on behalf of user)
  - Description: Run Triode A fit (current behaviour), then clone Triode B data, run second fit, plot green curves, populate properties column
  - Success Criteria: Red/green curves plotted together; property tables show Triode A/B side-by-side; change documented and easily revertable

#### Active Subtasks (Chronological)
- [x] Document triode A/B modelling plan in plan.md and tasks.md
- [x] Add measurement helper to detect Triode B data (no behavioural change)
- [x] Implement Triode B measurement clone helper (no behaviour change)

## Change Log

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:19 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Clean up secondary measurement resources when resetting modelling
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.cpp` (`cleanupTriodeBResources`)
- **Description**: Ensured Triode B measurement clone is deleted and pointer nulled when modelling resources are cleared so subsequent runs start from a clean state.
- **Impact**: Prevents stale secondary measurement data from leaking between modelling runs while we prepare the overlay change.
- **Testing**: Pending – requires running double-triode workflow after upcoming overlay adjustments.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:22 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Preserve Triode B clone after modelling and refresh analyser overlay
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.cpp` (`loadModel`)
- **Description**: Stopped nulling the Triode B measurement clone when model fitting completes and regenerate the blue measurement curves on the plot when both triodes have finished fitting.
- **Impact**: Allows analyser sweeps for Triode B to remain visible alongside Triode A without rerunning the analyser.
- **Testing**: Pending – verify by running double-triode fit and confirming blue sweeps render.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:24 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Refresh analyser measurement overlays after modelling completes
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.cpp` (`loadModel`)
- **Description**: Regenerate both primary (black) and secondary (blue) measurement curve groups after modelling so the analyser overlay always reflects the latest data.
- **Impact**: Ensures Triode A sweeps reappear when Triode B overlay is added.
- **Testing**: Pending – confirm both colours render simultaneously after a double-triode fit.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:32 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Overlay Triode B measurement without clearing axes
- **Files Modified**: `valvemodel/data/measurement.h`, `valvemodel/data/measurement.cpp`, `valveworkbench.cpp`
- **Description**: Added a variant of `Measurement::updatePlot` that skips axis clearing so the secondary overlay can reuse the existing axes while plotting its own sweeps.
- **Impact**: Prevents loss of Triode A curves and avoids plot redraw bugs when the secondary overlay is added.
- **Testing**: Pending – verify double-triode fit shows both black and blue sweeps and that toggling "Show Measurement" no longer crashes.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:45 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Colour-code secondary grid labels
- **Files Modified**: `valvemodel/ui/plot.h`, `valvemodel/ui/plot.cpp`, `valvemodel/data/sweep.cpp`
- **Description**: Allowed plot labels to take an explicit colour and propagate the measurement pen colour so Triode B grid-value annotations render in blue.
- **Impact**: Visual cues now stay consistent with measurement curves for both triodes.
- **Testing**: Pending – confirm blue label text appears alongside the blue sweeps after running the overlay.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 11:56 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Differentiate model plot colours between triodes
- **Files Modified**: `valvemodel/model/model.h`, `valvemodel/model/model.cpp`, `valveworkbench.cpp`
- **Description**: Added configurable plot colours to the model base class and set Triode A to red while Triode B uses green when plotted.
- **Impact**: Model overlays now visually distinguish primary and secondary fits when "Show Model" is enabled.
- **Testing**: Pending – verify that selecting the model node draws red curves for Triode A and green for Triode B.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 12:10 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Label project tree model entries by triode
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.cpp`
- **Description**: Renamed the first fitted model node to "Model A" and the second to "Model B", tinting their labels with the same colours used in the plot (red/green) for quick identification.
- **Impact**: Makes it obvious which tree item corresponds to each triode’s fit when browsing project entries.
- **Testing**: Pending – rerun a double-triode fit and confirm the project tree shows colourised "Model A" / "Model B" entries.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 12:22 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Keep secondary overlays when selecting sweeps
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.cpp`
- **Description**: Switched sweep selection rendering to reuse `updatePlotWithoutAxes` for the secondary measurement, align secondary sweeps with the primary index, and avoid plotting before the clone has data.
- **Impact**: Selecting individual grid sweeps now keeps both black and blue measurement curves visible without destabilising the scene, while leaving single-triode projects unaffected.
- **Testing**: Pending – select multiple sweeps after a double-triode run and confirm both colours remain and the app stays stable.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 13:03 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Auto-run initial triode fit on Modeller tab
- **Files Modified**: `valveworkbench.h`, `valveworkbench.cpp`
- **Description**: Added a one-shot guard so the first entry into the Modeller tab automatically kicks off a triode fit when a triode project is selected, then leaves subsequent runs to the user.
- **Impact**: Users land on the Modeller tab with both triode plots ready without needing to press "Fit Triode" immediately.
- **Testing**: Pending – launch app, open a triode project, switch to Modeller, and confirm the fit starts once; later visits shouldn’t auto-trigger.
- **Status**: pending

### [Date: 2025-10-31 13:35 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Design and implement Compare dialog model selection
- **Files Impacted**: `comparedialog.h`, `comparedialog.cpp`, `valveworkbench.cpp`, `ui_comparedialog.h`
- **Description**: Flesh out the Compare dialog so users can pick two fitted models (reference vs comparison) and evaluate triode/pentode metrics at user-entered test conditions. No implementation yet—requires UI widgets for selection plus logic to compute and display results.
- **Impact**: Enables side-by-side analysis of model fits without altering existing modelling workflow.
- **Status**: completed
- **Progress**:
  - 2025-10-31 14:04 UTC-07:00 — Step 1 complete: Added model selection panel and reorganised layout to host upcoming controls (`comparedialog.h`, `comparedialog.cpp`).
  - 2025-10-31 14:15 UTC-07:00 — Step 2 update: Model selectors now accept available model lists, preserve selections, and emit reference/comparison change signals (`comparedialog.h`, `comparedialog.cpp`).
  - 2025-10-31 14:55 UTC-07:00 — Step 3 complete: Compare dialog computes Mu, gm, rp, and Ia for triode/pentode test conditions, updating reference vs comparison labels on selection/input changes (`comparedialog.h`, `comparedialog.cpp`).
### [Date: 2025-10-22 13:30 UTC-07:00]

#### Task: Fix Device Dropdown Population
- **Files Modified**: `valvemodel/model/device.h`, `valvemodel/model/device.cpp`
- **Description**: Fixed constant mismatch between Device class and main application
- **Root Cause**: Device used MODEL_TRIODE (0) but circuit expected TRIODE (1)
- **Impact**: Device dropdowns now populated with available models
- **Testing**: Constants now match between Device (TRIODE=1) and main app (TRIODE=1)

**Files Modified:**
- c:\Users\lizar\Documents\ValveWorkbench\valvemodel\model\device.h:18,26-28,76
- c:\Users\lizar\Documents\ValveWorkbench\valvemodel\model\device.cpp:53,59

**Description:**
Fixed constant mismatch causing empty device dropdowns

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// device.h
+ #include "../constants.h"
- enum eModelDeviceType {
-     MODEL_TRIODE,
-     MODEL_PENTODE
- };
+ enum ePlotType { ... };

// device.cpp
- deviceType = MODEL_TRIODE;
