# Valve Workbench — Tasks & Change Log (AudioSmith)

Brand: AudioSmith — Darrin Smith, Nelson BC, Canada

## Active tasks (end‑user focused)
- [ ] Improve Designer plot robustness (no empty graphs, clear messages)
- [ ] Expand troubleshooting section in README (USB/ports, convergence)
- [ ] Add sample projects and screenshots
- [ ] Verify double‑triode property tables and legends

## Recently completed
- [x] Always prompt for project name before saving measurements
- [x] Modeller guard: flip positive grid voltages to negative during fitting
- [x] Fix model plotting infinite loop (grid stepping)

## Change log (highlights)
- 2025‑11‑02: Save‑to‑Project dialog prompts every time; modelling grid‑polarity guard
- 2025‑10‑21: Model plot loop fixed (correct grid stepping and bounds)

## Notes
- A = red (Triode A), B = green (Triode B)
- Measurements save into a Project; Modeller uses the selected measurement
